# Task Manager

## Description
Task Manager is a simple web-based application built with **Express.js** and the **EJS** template engine. The app allows users to organize their daily tasks by adding, viewing, and deleting them. Instead of using a database, the application stores the task data as individual files within a folder on the server, making it lightweight and easy to manage.

### Key Features:
- **Express.js** serves as the backend framework to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **EJS** is used as the template engine to dynamically render the task data on the frontend.
- Task data is stored locally in files (rather than a database), making it easy to persist the tasks across page reloads.
- Responsive design using **Bootstrap** ensures the app is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

With a simple, yet effective design, Task Manager allows users to focus on managing their tasks without needing a complex database setup.
